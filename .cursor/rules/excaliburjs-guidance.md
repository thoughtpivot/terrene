# Cursor Rule: ExcaliburJS Documentation Guidance (0.28.x)

## Rule

-   **Always provide documentation and code guidance for ExcaliburJS version 0.28.x.**
-   When giving code examples, API usage, or troubleshooting, ensure all advice is accurate for ExcaliburJS 0.28.x.
-   If a user asks about a feature, bug, or upgrade, recommend using the latest patch release of 0.28.x (e.g., 0.28.1, 0.28.2, etc.) if available, but do not recommend or use features from 0.28.0 or later.
-   Do not deviate from 0.28.x documentation or API guidance, even if newer versions exist.
-   When in doubt, reference the [ExcaliburJS 0.28.x documentation](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/0.28.0/).

## Rationale

-   This ensures all code and advice remains compatible with the project's locked engine version and avoids breaking changes from future releases.
